I'm a PhD student in cognitive neuroscience, and lecturer of statistics at UC Irvine. Before coming to UCI, I worked as a research assistant at Stanford University. My research interests lie at the intersection of motion perception and social cognition.

I'm the developer of [PyMVPA BIDS-App](https://github.com/BIDS-Apps/PyMVPA), a robust MultiVariate Pattern Analysis pipeline for fMRI data.
